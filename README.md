# Puiz 
A quiz game for Android and IOS made in flutter. 

The app and pictures can be seen here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.khalaf.puiz

I have written this in flutter, for the sole reason that you can develop both for Android and IOS as the same time,
whilst only having to maintain a single codebase.

# Puiz 
A quiz game for Android and IOS made in flutter. Code can be found under >lib

The app and pictures can be seen here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.khalaf.puiz

I have written this in flutter, for the sole reason that you can develop both for Android and IOS as the same time,
whilst only having to maintain a single codebase.

## left of:
    Added avatar support

## Todo:

    Sonner than later:
        Responsiveness Use MediaQuery.of()
        scroll on overflow (active quizzes)

     later:
        - let users make a custom avatar

        - debug
        - AND more debugging.
